## About
This app is a web based note taking app.

## Use
To use this app go to the webpage <!--(add webpage link later)-->.

Once at this link click on the "Get Started" button, this will take you to the notes page.

Once you are on the notes page the left hand side of the screen will show you the titles of the saved notes, and the right hand side of the screen will show the title of the currently selected note as well as its contacts.

As a user you can start a blank note by clicking the pencil in the upper right hand corner.

Then on the right hand side of the screen where it says title, enter the title of your note. You will enter your note content in the box below where you entered the title. Once you have text in both the title section and the content section then a save button will appear in the upper right hand corner next to the pencil symbol.

To save your note click on the save button and your new note will appear on the left hand side of the screen and will be saved. 

To delete a saved note click on the trash can next to that note and it will be removed.
